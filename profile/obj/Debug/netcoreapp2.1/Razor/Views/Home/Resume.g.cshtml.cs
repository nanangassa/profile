    2018 Prediction Algorithm<br />
    As part of a competition posted on the Kaggle website by Google, we were challenged to analyze the Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer by harnessing the power of Artificial intlligence. Several approaches were tried to train a model with one-year data of purchasing history using python, Sklearn, Numpy, panda and neural network architecture.

First had to write the dynamic buffer which could work in three mode, fixed, additive and multiplicative; then came the lexical analyser whose role was to scan the buffer in order to produce a stream of tokens which would be identified as identifiers, keywords or literals by the finite state machine and a transition table. The third step was to implement a symbol table manager and database that would also store variables type, initial values, line numbers and reserved attributes. And the last step was to write a Recursive Descent Predictive Parser in order to move from token to token and identify the syntax of the source code recursively until the end-of-file token.
